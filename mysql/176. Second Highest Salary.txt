Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

SELECT MAX(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary!=(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)


SELECT(
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1, 1
)AS 'SecondHighestSalary'
