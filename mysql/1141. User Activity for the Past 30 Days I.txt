Write an SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Activity_date as day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE Activity_date>'2019-06-27' AND Activity_date<='2019-07-27'
GROUP BY Activity_date;
